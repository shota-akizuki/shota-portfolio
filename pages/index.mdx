# Shota Akizuki

Hey, I'm a Web Designer, Developer at Company. I enjoy working with Next.js and crafting beautiful front-end experiences.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). Not only this site, but you can also check [my developer site](https://shota-dev.ml/).
